In Dr Racket, press Ctrl-R to run the tests. Ctrl-D twice to refocus the editor.

To run the tests via the command line, use:
  echo ./chapter-01b.scm | entr -c raco test /_

Although, running the script via the `racket` binary would work, I get a better output (and a non-zero exit code on failure!) with `raco test`.

Exercise 1.5:

Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using
applicativeorder evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0) 0 y))

ÓÅâen he evaluates the expression:

(test 0 (p))

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation?
What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation?

Explain your answer.

In normal-order evaluation, the inner parens will be evaluated first.

(test 0 (p)); evaluates to
(test 0 (p)); evaluates to
(test 0 (p)); evaluates to
(test 0 (p)); etc.

Because (p) is evaluated first, but since (p) is returned we enter an infinite loop.


In applicative-order evalution, the evaluation would have been:
(test 0 (p)); evaluates to
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p)); evaluates to
(if #t 0 (p)); evaluates to
0

Exercise 1.6
============

Define `new-if` and observe that it won't be usable with recursion.

Answer:
=======

We enter an infinite loop because of Lisp's applicative-order evaluation.
Both branches of `new-if` get evaluated, thus we recursively evaluate the false branch (even when the a branch is true).

(add (* 2 2) (* 3 3)) ; evaluates to:
(add 4 9) ; evaluates to:
13

We can also easily see this by tracing the function `new-if`
============================================================

(trace new-if)

1 ]=> (new-if #f 1 (+ 1 1))

[Entering #[compound-procedure 13 new-if]
    Args: #f
          1
          2]
[2
      <== #[compound-procedure 13 new-if]
    Args: #f
          1
          2]
;Value: 2

1 ]=> (new-if #t 1 (+ 1 1))

[Entering #[compound-procedure 13 new-if]
    Args: #t
          1
          2]
[1
      <== #[compound-procedure 13 new-if]
    Args: #t
          1
          2]
;Value: 1

Here, we can easily see that (+ 1 1) is always evaluated.

`if` is a special form that evaluates the predicate first, then evaluates branch a OR branch b.


============
*** NOTE ***
============

To debug the program, here's how to proceed:

Step 1: set a break
-------------------

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
 (bkpt guess x); <-- break point here, the arguments will be printed when hitting the breakpoint
 (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))



Step 2: load the program
-------------------------
Something like `rlwrap mit-scheme --load ./debug.scm`

Step 3: advance in the program
------------------------------
(continue)

I could not find any other debugging commands unfortunatly.
